# DIY_STL
My Personal STL Repository

Why:
As a student, I'm not allowed to use the Standard Template Library (STL) in my school projects. So, I decided to take the opportunity to learn and implement my own versions of the commonly used data structures and algorithms.

What:
This repository contains my own implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including:

- Containers (Vector, List, Stack, Queue, etc.)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Graph traversal, etc.)
- Data Structures (Tree, Graph, etc.)

Goals:

- Learn and understand the inner workings of the STL containers and algorithms
- Develop problem-solving skills and coding proficiency
- Create a useful library for personal projects and future reference

Note:
This repository is for learning purposes only and is not intended to be used in production environments.

Acknowledgments:
Special thanks to my school for motivating me to take this project on!
